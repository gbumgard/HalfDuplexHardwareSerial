sentence=Class wrapper that adds half-duplex support to Arduino HardwareSerial objects.
paragraph=Construct an instance of this class to add half-duplex support to the predefined hardware serial objects.
The hardware serial object to be wrapped is specified as a constructor argument.
Use the member functions on this wrapper to access the underlying Serial(n) instance.
Duplex control is provided by the setDirection() member function.
Restricting operation to the half-duplex modes allows the Rx and Tx pins to be tied to a one-wire serial bus.
